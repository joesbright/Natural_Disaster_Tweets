# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

This repository contains my submissions to the Kaggle Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets. Each notebook will have a filename like <pre><code>natural_disaster_METHOD</code></pre> where METHOD details how the classifcations were performed. E.g. <code>natural_disaster_tfif</code></pre> contains my competition submission using term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency (tfidf).
